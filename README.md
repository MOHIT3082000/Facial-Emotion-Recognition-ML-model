# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-ML-model
A Deep Learning-based model using CNN to classify emotions like happy, sad, angry, and neutral from images. Built with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, it supports real-time detection &amp; data augmentation for improved accuracy
😊 Facial Emotion Recognition - Multi-Class ML Model
🔍 Project Overview
This Facial Emotion Recognition System uses Deep Learning (CNN) to classify emotions from images. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and can recognize multiple emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, etc.

🚀 Features
✔ Multi-Class Emotion Detection – Detects emotions from facial images.
✔ Deep Learning Model (CNN) – Trained for high accuracy.
✔ Data Augmentation – Enhances model generalization.
✔ Transfer Learning – Improves classification performance.
✔ Real-Time Prediction – Can be integrated with a webcam or live feed.
